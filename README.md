# Simple Blockchain Simulator

This project is a basic blockchain simulator built in Rust. It demonstrates key blockchain concepts such as block creation, hashing, proof-of-work mining, and chain validation.

## Features
- Creates and mines blocks with a difficulty setting.
- Validates the blockchain's integrity.
- Uses SHA256 for hashing.

## Requirements
- Rust (https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
